# 3D Point Cloud Change Detection (3DCDNet)

This repository implements the 3DCDNet architecture for detecting structural changes between 3D point cloud datasets. It includes a synthetic **Cube Example** to demonstrate the model's ability to identify point-level differences.

# real time depth cam data example
This example consists of two images from different time:
1. **Initial State** 
2. **Changed State**
The model processes these inputs and generates a prediction that highlights exactly where the change is detected.


# commands to run:

     python run_camera_change.py
